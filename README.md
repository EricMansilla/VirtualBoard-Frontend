# VirtualBoardFrontend

Project made to practice development using web sockets, with backend in node.js and frontend in Angular.

### To run this project:
- Download this frontend.
- Download the [backend](https://github.com/monica-00/Virtual-Board-Backend).
- Run `npm install` on both projects.
- Run `npm start` on both projects.

### Test the app in 2 different browsers:
- Open `localhost:4200/room-1` in a browser (for example, Chrome).
- Open `localhost:4200/room-1` in another browser (for example, Firefox).
- Check that what is drawn in one browser is reflected in the other and vice versa.


    `room-1` can change, but it must be the same in one browser and another so that they are in the same room and what is drawn by one is reflected to the other.
